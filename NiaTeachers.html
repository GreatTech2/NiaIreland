            <h2>Ann Rigney, Dublin</h2>
            <p>I have been teaching Nia in Dublin since 2006. What I love about Nia is that there is something in it for everyone and this can all happen in one single class. Importantly, they can tailor the experience to suit their own needs while dancing together. The longer I practise Nia, the more I learn and experience its benefits in general life. I have danced through three pregnancies where I especially learned the importance of listening to the body and how I am feeling at any one moment. As a runner, I find I run better because of the body awareness I get from practising Nia. In a class, I feel powerful, strong, graceful, energised and balanced. If you’re looking for an activity that makes you feel like this and has lasting positive benefits and potential for learning, I invite you to Nia!</p>
            <p>I have been enjoying Nia with Ann for over 10 years now!
            Ann is a great teacher with a warm and welcoming personality and a passion for dance and body movement.
            The mix of super fun dance moves, great music, body awareness and mindfulness, thorough work out and relaxation, that is Nia has kept me sane and in shape from getting back to fitness after childbirth through sciatica to the slight creaks and cracks of middle aged womanhood and surely will for a long time to come!

            <h2>Liz Doherty, Antrim</h2>
            <p>Since discovering the Nia Dance Technique in March 2018 at a retreat in Scotland I have trained in three belts of Nia Dance (White, Green and Blue) and underwent two other related trainings; '52 Moves and 'Moving to Heal' in Scotland, London and Hamburg. I have been teaching Nia since September 2018 and currently teach 1 classes a week in Lisburn leisure centre (Classic Nia) and one in a women’s centre (Moving to Heal). I have just completed my Blue Belt online from Portland with Debbie Rosas in the US.</p>
                       
            <p>I am passionate about Nia, it has transformed my life and now I wish to share Nia with as many people as possible. Nia has become my main source of exercise as well as a mindfulness practice. I have developed a deeper relationship with my body from practising Nia which has benefited me on many levels. In Nia we speak about the Nia promise and Nia magic. It is that promise and magic that is the gift that keeps on giving.I currently teach Move to Heal online on Tuesdays at 5.15pm and individual session on request.</p>
                       
            <p>You can find me on FB at  Nia NI with Liz and Instagram at nia_ni_with_liz</p>

            <h2>Lal Hetherington, Cork</h2>
            <p>I came across Nia 4 years ago by accident when I went to a weekend workshop. Did not know anything about the subject, only it was on in a yoga studio, and as I was teaching yoga I was interested in learning new ideas. When I turned up on the Friday evening, there were only 3 people there, which was a big  surprise as it’s a very busy studio in the west side of the city.</p>
                       
            <p>The trainer had come over from Liverpool. As she began talking about “Floorplay”, rolling on the floor like a child, I thought, this is going to be the most boring class ever, and thinking no wonder there is only 3 people here. But as the class progressed, and the music started for the routine “Soul” I was hooked. It was life changing.</p>
               
            <p>The rest of the workshop was cancelled because of the small numbers. So just after dancing that one and only routine, came home and booked my flights to Scotland to do my “White Belt”. It is with the sense of joy in the music and movement, the freedom to explore connection to mind body spirt, and the health benefits that has encouraged me to  travel to England and Europe to do “Blue”, “Brown”  “Green” & “Black” Belts in the last couple of years.</p>
                       
            <p>I teach 3 classes a week:
Monday mornings @ 9 15am in Aghada Hall
Wednesday night @ 7 pm in Midleton
Friday mornings 9 30am in Cobh Community Centre
